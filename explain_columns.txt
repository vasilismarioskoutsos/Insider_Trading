This file explain all the column in .csv files

direction: A friendly label from acqDisp: A → ACQUIRED, D → DISPOSED.
strikeOrExercisePrice: If the security is a derivative (e.g., option, RSU that converts, warrant), this is the conversion/exercise price per unit. For ordinary common stock trades, it’s blank.
derivativeFlag: "Y" if the row came from the <derivativeTable> in the Form 4 XML; "N" for the <nonDerivativeTable> (i.e., the stock itself).
unitType: A normalized type inferred from securityTitle (your infer_unit_type helper). Examples: “Common Stock”, “Option”, “RSU”. If the title is unusual (e.g., “Common Shares”), it may fall back to “Other”.
isTenPctOwner: True means the person beneficially owns more than 10% of a registered class of the issuer’s equity securities at the time of the transaction

grossValue: shares * pricePerShare when pricePerShare > 0, otherwise blank (NaN). This is a simple cash notional (no fees).
signedShares: Signed quantity for aggregation: +shares when acqDisp == "A", -shares when "D", else 0.
netShares: Sum of signedShares over the group
(ownerCik, issuerCik, securityTitle, transactionDate). That total is then merged back onto every row in that group, so each row shows the same net figure for that day/security/owner.

footnoteIds: Any footnote anchors referenced in that transaction row (e.g., F1,F2).
footnotesText concatenates their text.

isAmendment: True when formTypeFromIndex == "4/A", else False.
